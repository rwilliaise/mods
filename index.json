First things first, ensure you have go binary installed on your machine.\n1git clone https://github.com/onweru/compose/ 2cd compose/exampleSite/ 3hugo server To pull in theme updates, run hugo mod get -u ./... from the theme folder. If unsure, learn how to update hugo modules\nIf you choose Option 2 or Option 3 below, ensure you edit these lines in the config.toml file as advised on the comments  Option 2 (recommended) Generate a new Hugo site and add this theme as a Git submodule inside your themes folder:\n1hugo new site yourSiteName 2cd yourSiteName 3git init 4git submodule add https://github.com/onweru/compose/ themes/compose 5cp -a themes/compose/exampleSite/* . Then run\n1hugo server Hurray!\nOption 3 (Great for testing quickly) You can run your site directly from the exampleSite. To do so, use the following commands:\n1git clone https://github.com/onweru/compose/ 2cd compose/exampleSite/ 3hugo server --themesDir ../..  Although, option 3 is great for quick testing, it is somewhat problematic when you want to update your theme. You would need to be careful not to overwrite your changes.  Once set, jump over to the config.toml file and start configuring your site.\n","link":"https://example.com/docs/compose/install-theme/","title":"Install theme"},{"body":"Do you prefer managing your site using a CMS? Or would you like to make it easier for someone (a non-techie, perhaps) in your team to make edits easily? If interested, follow along. Else, skip to the next section\nLet's sync your site with forestry CMS.\nPrerequisites !! Obviously you ought to have a github account. This is where your website source will live. Basically, forestry will read from github and write (commmit) to your github repo.\nGitlab or bitbucket will work too. Just check their implementation here. Happy fishing.  Requirement 1 : A Forestry account Jump over to forestry and sign up for an account. Consider signing up using your github account. That way, you don't have to deal with passwords.\nRequirement 2: A Netlify account (optional) If you intend to host with something other than Netlify e.g github pages, please scroll on. Hosting with Netlify is a lot of fun though; I highly recommend it.\nStep 1 : Fork or Clone Compse theme First we will fork this theme's template.\nStep 2 : Add your repository in Forestry The exampleSite already comes with prefilled default forestry settings. If you set up your site using option 2, look for a file .forestry/settings.yml and remove all exampleSite/ strings from it.  Go to your forestry account and click on import your site now.\n Choose hugo github or gitlab. wherever your repo is at. Select your repo  ","link":"https://example.com/docs/compose/use-forestry-cms/","title":"Use forestry CMS"},{"body":"This theme is primarily meant for documentation.\nDocumentation All your documentation content should be authored within the docs directory.\nUnlike other regular pages, the documentation pages will have a left sidebar. This sidebar will list links to all the pages in the documentation pages. Beneath each link, there will be a collapsible list of table of contents' links. These nested lists will unfold automatically on the active/current page.\nHome Page At the root level there's an _index.md page which is the homepage. Feel free to edit it as you like.\nOther pages You can also add as many regular pages as you like e.g about.md, contact.md...\nTake advantage of shortcodes to customize the layouts of these pages and any other.\nDoes this theme support blogging function? Currently, no.\n","link":"https://example.com/docs/compose/organize-content/","title":"Content organization"},{"body":"Instead of writing all your site pages from scratch, Hugo lets you define and use shortcodes.\nWhy shortcodes? While markdown is sufficient to produce simple pages, it's insufficient where complex page structures are needed. Thusly, whenever we need special styling, shortcodes compliment the shortcomings of markdown.\nThis way, you can side step complex html and css boilerplate in your content files.\nSometimes, the shortcode will wrap content, sometimes it won't. When content is wrapped, a closing shortcode tag is needed. Please see the link I provided above and the markdown files for examples. You'll get the gist pretty quickly.\nI've setup the following shortcodes:\nBlock Takes positional modifiers\nExample\n1... 2 {{\u0026lt; block \u0026#34;modifiers\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} 3 \u0026lt;!-- Nest columns or content --\u0026gt; 4 {{\u0026lt; /block \u0026gt;}} 5... Column It takes positional parameters\nExample\n1 {{\u0026lt; column \u0026#34;mt-2 mb-2\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} 2 \u0026lt;!-- applied margin top and margin bottom modifiers --\u0026gt; 3 {{\u0026lt; /column \u0026gt;}} Youtube Video This allows you to embed a youtube video in you content. You would achieve that using a positional parameter (needs no name )parameter, like so:\nSyntax\n1 {{\u0026lt; youtube \u0026#34;25QyCxVkXwQ\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} 2 \u0026lt;!-- Use the youtube video id --\u0026gt; Result\n  OR\nSyntax\n1\u0026lt;!-- or use full url --\u0026gt; 2{{\u0026lt; youtube \u0026#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmG2ah5Df4g\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Result\n  Button This adds a styled link (styled like a button). It takes two no-optional parameters:\n   PARAMETER PURPOSE OPTIONAL     label button text no   url button link no   modifier styling classes yes    Example\n1 {{\u0026lt; button \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; \u0026#34;doe nu mee\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Picture You want to use darkmode images when darkmode is enabled on a device and a regular image on lightmode? It takes 3 positional parameter\nStore these images in the static/images directory.\nSyntax\n1... 2{{\u0026lt; picture \u0026#34;lightModeImage.png\u0026#34; \u0026#34;darkModeImage.png\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Image alt text\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} 3... Result\n Gallery Include inline galleries within your articles. These galleries can contain N number of images. It takes 2 positional parameters.\nThe 1st parameter is required. It's a comma-separated list (,) of your images' paths.\nThe 2nd parameter is optional. It's a double-collon-separated list (::) of your images' alt/description/captions text. It's always a good SEO practice to include alt text for your images.\nSyntax\n1... 2{{\u0026lt; gallery \u0026#34;images/painting.jpg,images/scribble.jpg,images/painting.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Gallery Image 1::gallery image 2::gallery image 1 copy\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} 3...   For legibility, you may include a space after the delimiters , \u0026amp; ::\n  Result\n    Tip Use this short if you want to publish informational tooltips that look like:\nThis tooltips may take either of the following forms:\nSyntax\n1{{\u0026lt; tip \u0026gt;}} 2Something of __interest__ you want to highlight 3{{\u0026lt; /tip \u0026gt;}} Result\nSomething of interest you want to highlight  OR\nSyntax\n1{{\u0026lt; tip \u0026#34;warning\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} 2Something of __interest__ the user should be careful about 3{{\u0026lt; /tip \u0026gt;}} Result\nSomething of interest the user should be careful about  ","link":"https://example.com/docs/compose/shortcodes/","title":"Shortcodes"},{"body":"Firstly, ensure you have these lines inside your config.toml file\n1[outputs] 2 home = [\u0026#34;HTML\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;RSS\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;JSON\u0026#34;] Compose implements fuse.js to enable search functionality. At the time of this writing, search on these theme takes either of this forms:\n1. Passive search This occurs only when the user loads the search page i.e /search/. They can directly navigate to that url. Alternatively, the user can type you search query on the search field and click enter. They will be redirected to the search page which will contain matched results if any.\n2. Live search This behaviour will be obvious as the user types a search query on the search field. All valid search queries, will yield a list of quick links or a simple no matches found. Else, the user will be prompted to continue typing.\n Please note that the results under quick links will be a truncated list of the most relevant results. Only a maximum of 8 items will be returned. This number is pragmatic at best if not arbitrary. On the search page, the number is set to 12.\n Note that live search on the search page will behave differently than on the other pages. Nonetheles, the pages apply the same live search principle.\n Hitting enter while typing on the search page will be moot as that page’s content will live update as you type in the search word / phrase.\n Customize search feedback labels Use the i18n files to do so.\nWhat is a valid search query A valid search query must be long enough. If the search query can be cast as a float, then it only need contain one or more characters.\nElse the search query must be at least 2 characters long.\n","link":"https://example.com/docs/compose/search/","title":"Search Function"},{"body":"Mermaid is library that helps you generate diagrams, flowcharts, and piecharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.\nWith compose theme, you can use mermaid using a custom shortcode as follows:\nSequence Diagrams Syntax\n1{{\u0026lt; mermaid \u0026gt;}}2sequenceDiagram 3participant Alice 4participant Bob 5Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? 6loop Healthcheck 7John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria 8end 9Note right of John: Rational thoughts\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;prevail... 10John--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great! 11John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you? 12Bob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good! 13{{\u0026lt; /mermaid \u0026gt;}}Result\nsequenceDiagram participant Alice participant Bob Alice-John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughtsprevail...

You would need to be careful not to overwrite your changes.\n Option 3 (The new, most fun \u0026amp; painless approach) This option enables you to load this theme as a hugo module. It arguably requires the least effort to run and maintain in your website.\nFirst things first, ensure you have go binary installed on your machine.\n1git clone https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity.git clarity 2cd clarity/exampleSite/ 3hugo mod init my-site Open config.toml file in your code editor, replace theme = \u0026quot;hugo-clarity\u0026quot; with theme = [\u0026quot;github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity\u0026quot;] or just theme = \u0026quot;github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity\u0026quot;.\nHurray you can now run\n1hugo serverTo pull in theme updates, run hugo mod get -u ./... from the theme folder.

I.e., if the underlying OS is set to dark mode, the site will automatically load in dark mode. Regardless of the default mode, a UI control switch exists to override the theme mode at the user's discretion.\nIn order to override this behavior and force one mode or another, add either enforceLightMode or enforceDarkMode to your config.toml file. If neither value is present, add it.\nTo enforce Light Mode by default, turn enforceLightMode to true.\nTo enforce Dark Mode by default, turn enforceDarkMode to true\n1[params]2...3enforceLightMode = true# Force the site to always load in light mode.4...Please note that you cannot enforce both modes at the same time. It wouldn't make sense, would it?\n Please also note that the mode toggle UI will remain in place. That way, if a user prefers dark mode, they can have their way. The best of both worlds.\n  I18N This theme supports Multilingual (i18n / internationalization / translations)\nThe exampleSite gives you some examples already. You may extend the multilingual functionality by following the official documentation.\nThings to consider in multilingual:\n supported languages are configured in config/_default/languages.toml add new language support by creating a new file inside i18n directory. Check for missing translations using hugo server --i18n-warnings taxonomy names (tags, categories, etc...) are translated in i18n as well (translate the key) menus are translated manually in the config files config/_default/menus/menu.xx.toml menu's languages list are semi-hardcoded. You may chose another text for the menu entry with languageMenuName. Please, do better and create a PR for that. content must be translated individually. Read the official documentation for information on how to do it.  note: if you do NOT want any translations (thus removing the translations menu entry), then you must not have any translations. In the exampleSite that's as easy as removing the extra translations from the config/_default/... or executing this onliner:\nsed '/^\\[pt]$/,$d' -i config/_default/languages.toml \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm config/_default/menus/menu.pt.toml Comments Clarity supports Hugo built-in Disqus partial, you can enable Disqus simply by setting disqusShortname in your configuration file.\n disqusShortname should be placed in root level of configuration.\n  You can also create a file named layouts/partials/comments.html for customizing the comments, checkout Comments Alternatives for details.\n","link":"https://example.com/docs/clarity/customize/","title":"Customization"},{"body":"Images Image figure captions You have the option of adding captions to images in blog posts and automatically prepending a desired string such as \u0026quot;Figure N\u0026quot; to the alt text. This is controlled via two global settings.\nfigurePositionLabel is a string which will be prepended to any alt text of an article image. By default, this is set to \u0026quot;Figure.\u0026quot; And figurePositionShow controls, globally, whether to show this label. It does not affect whether to show the image alt text, only the prefix figure caption. For more granular control, figurePositionShow can be overridden at the article level if desired.\nThe number will be automatically calculated and assigned after the figurePositionLabel text starting from the top of the article and counting down. Featured images will be excluded from this figuration.\nImage figure captions example In this example, figurePositionLabel is set to \u0026quot;Figure\u0026quot; in config.toml and this is the first image in a given article.\n1![Antrea Kubernetes nodes prepared](./images/calrity/image-figure.png) Inline images To make a blog image inline, append :inline to its alt text.

Thumbnails should be square (height:width ratio of 1:1) and a suggested dimension of 150 x 150 pixels. They will be specified using a frontmatter variable as follows:\n1...2thumbnail:\u0026#34;images/2020-04/capv-overview/thumbnail.jpg\u0026#34;3...The thumbnail image will take precedence on opengraph share tags if the shareImage parameter is not specified.\nArticle featured image Each article can specify an image that appears at the top of the content.
